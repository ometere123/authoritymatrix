# Deployment

## Target

AuthorityMatrix is locked to GenLayer Studionet:

- Network: Studionet
- Chain ID: 61999
- RPC: https://studio.genlayer.com/api
- Explorer: https://explorer-studio.genlayer.com/

## Reproduction checks

```bash
python scripts/preflight.py
python -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest tests/direct/ -v -s
```

Deployment used GenLayer CLI 0.39.1. Before deployment, the RPC `eth_chainId` was checked as `0xf22f` (decimal 61999).

## Superseded AuthorityMatrix deployment

The address and evidence below are for the pre-fix interface. That deployment independently accepted description and action hash and must not be used as evidence for the description/action commitment review requirement. Deploy a new AuthorityMatrix from current source and a new AuthorityGate configured for its address; existing immutable deployments cannot acquire the revised logic.

### Multi-domain action and approvals

Action 1 used context hash `11` repeated 32 bytes and action hash `22` repeated 32 bytes. Its description was: “Pay a 40 GEN invoice to an external security vendor for a production penetration test and grant the vendor privileged access to customer-data-derived test records.”

## Verification record

The following verification is historical pre-fix evidence and does not validate current main:

- Historical source commit: `0ada2a68b2a34aeea52a27ad55e1a453267b6a3a`.
- Historical GitHub Actions run: [35471002444](https://github.com/ometere123/authoritymatrix/actions/runs/35471002444).

This record is superseded by current-main verification below. No frontend was added.

## Corrected deployment

The corrected interface stores a domain-separated commitment over `context_hash`, `action_hash`, and the Keccak-256 hash of the normalized classified description. `is_authorized_for` requires the expected description hash and expected commitment, checks both against stored state, and recomputes the commitment. `AuthorityGate.execute` requires and forwards both values before recording execution.

The corrected deployment and end-to-end binding proof have now been completed on Studionet (61999) using the repository-local GenLayer CLI 0.39.1. The source returned by each deployed address was retrieved and compared to commit `82ed8647403540b1378ab6f37aa30efc2eb800df`; after normalizing deployed CRLF line endings to LF, both deployed files equal their Git blobs byte-for-byte.

Deployed source byte counts and hashes are computed from the exact UTF-8 source fetched from Studionet. Git stores normalized LF blobs, so these differ in byte count/hash from the deployed CRLF representation; CRLF-to-LF normalization yields exact equality with the respective source blob at the stated commit.

The gate is bound to context hash `9d0b60fc4e8005409a78683d53aa781bf5ff69f431a8ca3079f5285857f46dca`. Its deployed schema was read back and contains the corrected `execute(action_id, expected_action_hash, expected_description_hash, expected_action_commitment, expected_matrix_hash)` interface.

### On-chain matching and mismatch proof

A fresh matrix `1` was created and sealed with definition hash `990eb237c95c6819d354573733cc5596d2e172d3f723b308c6d4993eb642a447`, one `scope` dimension, threshold 1, and the deployment account as approver. Two actions were opened under the gate's fixed context, semantically classified, and authorized:

- Action 1: `Pay 40 GEN from treasury to an external vendor.` Action hash `22…22`; description hash `d2dc0ab8e40354a8b0d95e0d9b4240261b3dac0db6dd92f14894ebfb8b4ee3d5`; commitment `5933e947419f5b7eb97a216631601463628225cdaa961a23e732a47da39027f3`.
- Action 2: `Transfer 15 GEN from treasury to the approved supplier.` Action hash `33…33`; description hash `e905217b87af0be2dbb1c65f248d086fdb1e3caec1d4935b60b6af96bfb61158`; commitment `02e2039150fe91ad9de884cba922e3f680ed52320880dcbc39eeead53f71c2a8`.

The matching Action 1 call to `AuthorityGate.execute` finalized successfully in transaction [`0x53aed9ab908be554ab515766359930b943a8921ec6775e3df6b82cc34ae0aef0`](https://explorer-studio.genlayer.com/tx/0x53aed9ab908be554ab515766359930b943a8921ec6775e3df6b82cc34ae0aef0). `get_execution(22…22)` read back the exact action hash, description hash, commitment, context hash, matrix hash, and action ID; `was_executed(22…22)` returned true.

For Action 2, the gate was called with a deliberately altered description hash and the original action commitment. Transaction [`0xd3da2fdf2a629fa2d6571b4e35577c4c0ef8941f7ebac9e90b768fef428949b7`](https://explorer-studio.genlayer.com/tx/0xd3da2fdf2a629fa2d6571b4e35577c4c0ef8941f7ebac9e90b768fef428949b7) finalized with MAJORITY_AGREE and the expected execution error `EXPECTED: AuthorityMatrix authorization is not valid for this consumer`. Readback confirmed `was_executed(33…33)=false`. Thus the same already-authorized action is rejected when the consumer-supplied description binding is changed.

An earlier gate deployment attempt, transaction `0xbb16a88f29d4c237c20be38a6c027f6206fca8f8887d8701f837d7c4fb26f29c`, finalized with execution error and did not create a contract. The valid gate address and proof above supersede that failed attempt.

### Current-main automated verification

The current suite contains 28 tests, including `test_authorized_action_rejects_description_from_different_action_commitment`. The newest [AuthorityMatrix CI run for `main`](https://github.com/ometere123/authoritymatrix/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain) is the current-main preflight and Direct Mode evidence; it supersedes the historical run listed above.

On this Windows/WSL workstation, the local Direct Mode runner fails during GenLayer harness initialization (`DecodingError: unexpected end of memory`) before contract tests execute. The GitHub Actions Linux runner is the passing Direct Mode result for current main. Python compile and repository preflight are also run locally before publication.
